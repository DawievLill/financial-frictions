### 1.1. Krusell-Smith economy
**The first example.** A comprehensive tutorial in the context of a simple, well-known HA model. It shows how to compute the model using both a linear regression (standard approach) and a neural network. The computation takes less than 2 hours on average (depending on the computer).
### 1.2. Model with financial intermediaries
**The second example.** This is the model that we solve in the paper. We omit an extensive description as it can be found in the Appendix, but we provide a description of the files. The computation takes around 12 hours on average.
### 1.3. Replication files
**Extra features.** The complete replication files, including the estimation and all the exercises and robustness analyses. Just launch a0_superlaunch.m and relax for three weeks, which is the average time to run the whole code in a normal computer.
